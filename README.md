# react-camera

This is simple react camera component example.

The motivation behind this is that I needed a camera control in an electron app running on a windows tablet, so that users can take photos.

As such, needed to implement a camera component with optical zoom and capture functionality using react.


# Zoom 

use the zoom controls on the right side of the component ( buttons and slider ). 

# Capture photo

click on the video
